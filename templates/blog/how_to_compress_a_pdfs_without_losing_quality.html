    Struggling with oversized PDF files? In this article, you'll learn how to reduce PDF file size efficiently without compromising the quality of images, text, or layout — using a secure and free online tool.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Why Compress a PDF?</h2>
  <p>
    Large PDF files are difficult to email, upload to websites, or store in cloud systems. Compressing a PDF solves these problems by reducing file size through optimization techniques such as image scaling, metadata cleanup, and font subsetting.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, not all compression tools are equal. Low-quality tools may degrade image clarity or break layout structures. That's why it's important to choose a tool that prioritizes quality retention — like PDFHub.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Step-by-Step Guide to Compress a PDF</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Open the compression tool:</strong><br>
      Visit <a href="https://pdfhub.org/compress-pdf" target="_blank">https://pdfhub.org/compress-pdf</a>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Upload your file:</strong><br>
      Drag and drop your PDF or use the file selector to upload.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Automatic compression:</strong><br>
      PDFHub will detect images, fonts, and structure to apply the most effective compression with minimal quality loss.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Download the result:</strong><br>
      After processing, download your optimized PDF. Layout, fonts, and text remain intact.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Typical Compression Results</h2>
  <p>
    While results vary based on content, here are two common examples:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>5.4 MB → 1.3 MB</strong> (image-heavy report)</li>
    <li><strong>2.2 MB → 700 KB</strong> (mixed text/image brochure)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>No visual degradation observed in either case.</em></p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Is It Safe?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. All files are transmitted over HTTPS and are automatically deleted from PDFHub servers within 60 minutes. No sign-up, no tracking, and no file retention.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Why Use PDFHub for Compression?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lossless optimization when possible</li>
    <li>No watermark or login required</li>
    <li>Works on all platforms (desktop & mobile)</li>
    <li>Completely free and ad-light</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h2>

    Compressing a PDF shouldn't cost quality. PDFHub ensures efficient, secure, and smart file size reduction — all in your browser, without any installation or account required.
